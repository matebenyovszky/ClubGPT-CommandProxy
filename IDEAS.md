✅ Forward API key to remote machine
◻️ If API key is empty, only allow remote run
◻️ Print out key and ipaddress locally
◻️ Check machine type, so know what kind of commands could be run
◻️ General GPT, hide innecessary information
◻️ Encoding - decoding for special characters? (see "Hello World!" folder creation - URL encode?/hash)
◻️ Open file from remote machine
◻️ Screenshot sharing
◻️ Save file to remote machine
◻️ Search files / in files on remote machine
◻️ Create an EXE file to easily run the application for everyone (random generated key?)
◻️ Update website
◻️ Ask for user input pairing option with server?! Server just generates a new session key? If there is no code, just URL, and session mode, generate a new key?
◻️ Run using only ip address, but with ssl?
◻️ Update readme, clean up code, update website
◻️ Create test deployment
◻️ File upload-download, make folder content available through endpoint?
◻️ SSL cert verification off/on
◻️ Websocket stream
◻️ Random time limited keys for executors (servers), not for sessions
◻️ Other party in an agent, tell just the task exactly
